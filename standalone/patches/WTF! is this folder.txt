The New-Patch System

1. to provide easier updates for Patches
2. to provide static links for Launchers

*.*.*.patch (version):
-provides A patch from version 1.0 to the filename version.
-allways stays the same even if new version is released

latest.patch :
-a patch to 1.0 from latest force-update version
-updated with script or batch each version



That way Launchers can:
-patch their downloaded version to 1.0
-patch 1.0 to whatever version (including latest) they need
